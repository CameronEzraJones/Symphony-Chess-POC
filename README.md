# Chessboard

A responsive, empty 8 × 8 chessboard implementing FIDE Article 2.1: 64 equal squares alternate light and dark, with a light square at the near right corner for either player (bottom-right and top-left on screen).

## Run

Requires Node.js 22 or later and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Verify

```sh
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:coverage
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

The end-to-end tests start the production server, verify every square's dimensions, position and rendered color on desktop and mobile, and capture desktop and mobile screenshots. To use a locally installed Chrome, set `CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome`.

Coverage uses c8/V8 with source maps for all application components. CI publishes measured statement, branch, function and line totals in a `coverage` Check Run using the Symphony marker and the PR head SHA.

## Screenshots

Each CI run uploads desktop and mobile PNG screenshots in the `chessboard-screenshots` artifact on its Actions run page. Local end-to-end runs write the same images to `docs/screenshots/`.
